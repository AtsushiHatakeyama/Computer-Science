## What is DNS?

Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (such as www.example.com) into numerical IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers can understand. When you enter a domain name into your web browser, your computer contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address. It then uses the IP address to establish a connection with the website's server and download the website's content.

### What is the advantage of DNS
There are several advantages to using Domain Name System (DNS):

 - Ease of use: <br>
DNS allows users to access websites and other resources on the internet using easily-remembered domain names rather than having to remember numerical IP addresses. This makes it much easier for people to use the internet and helps to make it more user-friendly.


 - Improved reliability:<br>
DNS servers are distributed across the internet, which means that if one server goes down, users can still access websites and other resources by using a different server. This helps to improve the reliability and availability of internet services.


 - Enhanced security: <br>
DNS servers use various security measures to protect against attacks and ensure the integrity of internet communication. For example, DNS servers can use encryption to secure communication and verify the authenticity of DNS responses.


 - Greater scalability: <br>
DNS allows internet resources to be accessed using domain names, which means that the number of resources that can be accessed on the internet is virtually unlimited. This helps to ensure that the internet can continue to grow and evolve over time.


 - Improved performance: <br>
DNS servers use caching to store recently-resolved domain names, which can improve the performance of internet services by reducing the time it takes to resolve domain names.

Overall, DNS plays a critical role in the functioning of the internet and provides many benefits to users.
