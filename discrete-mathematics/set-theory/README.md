# Set
## What is Set?
In discrete mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members, that are considered as a single entity.<br>
Sets are an important concept in discrete mathematics because they allow us to define and manipulate the structure of collections of objects. <br>
Sets are typically denoted by enclosing the elements in curly braces, for example: {1, 2, 3, 4}. 
The order of the elements in a set is usually not important, so {1, 2, 3, 4} is considered to be the same set as {4, 3, 2, 1}.<br>
Some sets can be infinite, for example the set of all natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).<br>
Sets can be used to represent relationships between objects, for example, we can define a set of all the students in a class, or a set of all the countries in the world. Sets are a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science, and they have many applications in various fields such as computer algorithms, data structures, and programming languages.

### Element of set (∈)
As mentioned above sentence, element is a member of a set. It is a specific object that belongs to a set. 

For example, in the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, the elements are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

In Discrete mathematics, element can be denote as ∈. ∈ ---> Element
